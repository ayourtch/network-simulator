Read README.md as well as the plans in docs/plans. The goal is to have a fully functioning simulator, with all functionality properly working, nothing stubbed. You can also add a custom mock for a tun input/output that would allow you to play packets from text files (you define and document the format), and capture the results.

you commit the in progress work whenever it compiles and passes the tests.
