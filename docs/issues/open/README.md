# Open Issues Index

This directory contains documented open issues for the network simulator project. Each issue is small, granular, and designed to be implementable by a less experienced developer. When you address a given issue, please move it to the docs/issues/resolved/ directory (thus, ../resolved relative to this one). You can also add "Fix summary" section to the file after moving it, documenting what you have done and why.

There is no issue summary here - use the directory listing to find the issues.
